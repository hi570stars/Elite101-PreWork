# Elite101-PreWork
This is a chatbot project as pre-work for my Elite 101 Class with Code2College!<br/>

## This section is added to the new branch
This branch will be pushed to the repository as a new branch. <br/>
My name is Sneha. <br/>

### Code has been updated: this is a FitterBot which shows not only your style but where you can get an outfit similar to your style! There are 8 different outcomes. I went a different route than most chatbots and made it more of a quiz chatbot, but it still conversates with the user, hence I regard it to be a chatbot. I just wanted to do something a little different: instead of tell the user prices for the products they want, I "analyze" the user's choices *in a simple manner* and give them their style aesthetic! 

#### my code has comments regarding what each section does, but essentially: it's broken up by a greeting, a check in with the user, Asking a question to narrow down 4 style choices out of 8, and then going in and asking a question to narrow down 1 out of the 4. Next, the style, some clothing choices, and stores are outputted, with a would you like to try again option. This option also shows up when the user enters something unexpected so they can try again and it restarts their progress. Lastly, they can enter STOP to stop the conversation anytime!
